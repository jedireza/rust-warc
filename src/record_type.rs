    /// A `response` record should contain a complete scheme-specific response,

    /// contents of a `response` record are determined not just by the record
    /// type but also by the URI scheme of the record's target-URI, as described
    /// below.
    ///
    /// See annex C.2 below for an example of a ‘response’ record.
    ///
    /// ### for `http` and `https` scheme
    ///
    /// For a target-URI of the `http` or `https` schemes, a `response` record
    /// block should contain the full HTTP response received over the network,
    /// including headers. That is, it contains the `response` message defined
    /// by section 6 of HTTP/1.1 (RFC2616), or by any previous or subsequent
    /// version of HTTP compatible with the section 6 of HTTP/1.1 (RFC2616).
    ///
    /// The WARC record's Content-Type field should contain the value defined by
    /// HTTP/1.1, `application/http;msgtype=response`. When software bugs,
    /// network issues, or implementation limits cause response-like material to
    /// be collected that is not perfectly compliant with HTTP specifications,
    /// WARC writing software may record the problematic content us ing its best
    /// effort determination of the interesting material boundaries. That is,
    /// neither the use of the `response` record with an `http` target-URI nor
    /// the `application/http` `content-type` serves as an absolute guarantee
    /// that the contained material is a legal HTTP response.
    ///
    /// A `WARC-IP-Address` field should be used to record the network IP
    /// address from which the response material was received.
    ///
    /// When a `response` is known to have been truncated, this shall be noted
    /// using the `WARC-Truncated` field.

    /// A `resource` record contains a resource, without full protocol response
    /// information. For example: a file directly retrieved from a locally
    /// accessible repository or the result of a networked retrieval where the
    /// protocol information has been discarded. The exact contents of a
    /// `resource` record are determined not just by the record type but also by
    /// the URI scheme of the record's `target-uri`, as described below.

    /// For all `resource` records, the payload is defined as the record block.
    ///
    /// A `resource` record, with a synthesized `target-uri`, may also be used
    /// to archive other artefacts of a harvesting process inside WARC files.
    ///
    /// See annex C.3 below for an example of a ‘resource’ record.
    ///
    /// ### for `http` and `https` schemes
    ///
    /// For a target-URI of the `http` or `https` schemes, a `resource` record
    /// block shall contain the returned `entity-body` (per [RFC2616], with any
    /// transfer-encodings removed), possibly truncated.
    ///
    /// ### for `ftp` scheme
    ///
    /// For a target-URI of the `ftp` scheme, a `resource` record block shall
    /// contain the complete file returned by an FTP operation, possibly
    /// truncated.
    ///
    /// ### for `dns` scheme
    ///
    /// For a `target-uri` of the `dns` scheme ([RFC4501]), a `resource` record
    /// shall contain material of `content-type` 'text/dns' (registered by

    ///
    /// A `metadata` record contains content created in order to further
    /// describe, explain, or accompany a harvested resource, in ways not
    /// covered by other record types.  A `metadata` record will almost always
    /// refer to another record of another type, with that other record holding

    /// The format of the metadata record block may vary. The
    /// `application/warc-fields` format, defined earlier, may be used.

    Metadata,
    /// `revisit` as defined in ISO28500; section 6.7
    ///
    /// ### General
    ///
    /// A `revisit` record describes the revisitation of content already
    /// archived, and might include only an abbreviated content body which has
    /// to be interpreted relative to a previous record. Most typically, a
    /// `revisit` record is used instead of a `response` or `resource` record to
    /// indicate that the content visited was either a complete or substantial
    /// duplicate of material previously archived.
    ///
    /// Using a `revisit` record instead of another type is optional, for when
    /// benefits of reduced storage size or improved cross-referencing of
    /// material are desired.
    ///
    /// A `revisit` record shall contain a `WARC-Profile` field which determines
    /// the interpretation of the record's fields and record block. Two initial
    /// values and their interpretation are described in the following sections.
    /// A reader which does not recognize the profile URI shall not attempt to
    /// interpret the enclosing record or associated content body.
    ///
    /// The purpose of this record type is to reduce storage redundancy when
    /// repeatedly retrieving identical or little-changed content, while still
    /// recording that a revisit occurred, plus details about the current state
    /// of the visited content relative to the archived version.
    ///
    /// See annex C.6 below for an example of a ‘revisit’ record.
    ///
    /// ### Profile: Identical Payload Digest
    ///
    /// This `revisit` profile may be used whenever a subsequent consideration
    /// of a URI provides payload content which a strong digest function, such
    /// as SHA-1, indicates is identical to a previously recorded version.
    ///
    /// To indicate this profile, use the URI:
    ///
    /// ```plain
    /// http://netpreserve.org/warc/1.0/revisit/identical-payload-digest
    /// ```
    ///
    /// To report the payload digest used for comparison, a `revisit` record
    /// using this profile shall include a `WARC-Payload-Digest` field, with a
    /// value of the digest that was calculated on the payload.
    ///
    /// A `revisit` record using this profile may have no record block, in which
    /// case a Content-Length of zero must be written. If a record block is
    /// present, it shall be interpreted the same as a `response` record type
    /// for the same URI, but truncated to avoid storing the duplicate content.
    /// A `WARC-Truncated` header with reason `length` shall be used for any
    /// identical-digest truncation.
    ///
    /// For records using this profile, the payload is defined as the original
    /// payload content whose digest value was unchanged.
    ///
    /// Using a `WARC-Refers-To` header to identify a specific prior record from
    /// which the matching content can be retrieved is recommended, to minimize
    /// the risk of misinterpreting the `revisit` record.
    ///
    /// ### Profile: Server Not Modified
    ///
    /// This `revisit` profile may be used whenever a subsequent consideration
    /// of a URI encounters an assertion from the providing server that the
    /// content has not changed, such as an HTTP "304 Not Modified" response.
    ///
    /// To indicate this profile, use the URI:
    ///
    /// ```plain
    /// http://netpreserve.org/warc/1.0/revisit/server-not-modified
    /// ```
    ///
    /// A `revisit` record using this profile may have no content body, in which
    /// case a Content-Length of zero shall be written. If a content body is
    /// present, it should be interpreted the same as a `response` record type
    /// for the same URI, truncated if desired.
    ///
    /// For records using this profile, the payload is defined as the original
    /// payload content from which a `Last-Modified` and/or `ETag` value was
    /// taken.
    ///
    /// Using a `WARC-Refers-To` header to identify a specific prior record from
    /// which the unmodified content can be retrieved is recommended, to
    /// minimize the risk of misinterpreting the `revisit` record.
    ///
    /// ### Other profiles
    ///
    /// Other documents may define additional profiles to accomplish other
    /// goals, such as recording the apparent magnitude of difference from the
    /// previous visit, or to encode the visited content as a "diff" -- where
    /// "diff" is the file comparison utility that outputs the differences
    /// between two files -- of the content previously stored.
    Revisit,
    /// `conversion` as defined in ISO28500; section 6.8
    ///
    /// A `conversion` record shall contain an alternative version of another
    /// record's content that was created as the result of an archival process.
    /// Typically, this is used to hold content transformations that maintain
    /// viability of content after widely available rendering tools for the
    /// originally stored format disappear. As needed, the original content may
    /// be migrated (transformed) to a more viable format in order to keep the
    /// information usable with current tools while minimizing loss of
    /// information (intellectual content, look and feel, etc). Any number of
    /// `conversion` records may be created that reference a specific source
    /// record, which may itself contain transformed content. Each
    /// transformation should result in a freestanding, complete record, with no
    /// dependency on survival of the original record.
    ///
    /// Metadata records may be used to further describe transformation records.
    /// Wherever practical, a `conversion` record should contain a
    /// `WARC-Refers-To` field to identify the prior material converted.
    ///
    /// For `conversion` records, the payload is defined as the record block.
    ///
    /// See annex C.7 below for an example of a ‘conversion’ record.
    Conversion,
    /// `continuation` as defined in ISO28500; section 6.9
    ///
    /// Record blocks from `continuation` records must be appended to
    /// corresponding prior record block(s) (e.g., from other WARC files) to
    /// create the logically complete full-sized original record. That is,
    /// `continuation` records are used when a record that would otherwise cause
    /// a WARC file size to exceed a desired limit is broken into segments. A
    /// continuation record shall contain the named fields
    /// `WARC-Segment-Origin-ID` and `WARC-Segment-Number`, and the last
